# Hey!

I'm a technology enthusiast, very active and always willing to learn something new. I'm always excited to be wrong, and overjoyed to delete my own code. You'll find me using C# and TypeScript. I'm specially interested in distributed systems design, TDD, object-oriented programming and performance. Lately studying functional programming in Elixir and Erlang.

Non engineering stuff I do: 🎸 - 🎹 - 🎶 - ⚽ - 🌱 - 📚 - 🍳 - 🌍

## Have a nice day!
