# Hey!

I'm a technology enthusiast, very active and always willing to learn something new. I'm always excited to be wrong, and overjoyed to delete my own code. I'm specially interested in distributed systems design, TDD, object-oriented programming and performance. I have >6 years of experience programming in C# and TypeScript. Lately I'm studying functional programming in Elixir and Erlang. Using Claude Code extensively nowadays.

Non engineering stuff I do: 🎸 - 🎹 - 🎶 - ⚽ - 🌱 - 📚 - 🍳 - 🌍

## Have a nice day!
