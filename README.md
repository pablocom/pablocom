# Hey!

I'm a technology enthusiast, very active and always willing to learn something new. I'm always excited to be wrong, and overjoyed to delete my own code.

I'm happy working at Schroders. You'll find me using C# and Typescript. I'm specially interested in distributed systems design, object-oriented programming and performance.

Non engineering stuff I do: 🎸 - 🎹 - 🎶 - ⚽ - 🌱 - 📚 - 🍳 - 🌍

## Have a nice day!
